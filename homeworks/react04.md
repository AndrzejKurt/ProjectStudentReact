# React 04

## for volunteers

To submit the solution (and before you start working):

1. Checkout to the new branch with your name (`git checkout -b react-04/Serhii`)
2. Commit your solution
3. Push it to your branch (not to the main branch!)

4. Investigate react lifecycles for class component
5. Investigate react lifecycles throught react hooks
6. Add validation for each input
7. Present validation error message under certain input
8. Pole Grade musi być liczbą w przedziale od 1 do 6

## for Pros

1. Add functionality if one user answering for others "answers" button should be disabled. Tip: button has prop `disabled={<boolean>}`
2. Create parent component with 2 children components. Child component is input. When we change the input in one child, the same value should be applied to another child and vice verse.
3. Run validation after user stops their iteraction with the input
