# React 03

## for volunteers

To submit the solution (and before you start working):

1. Checkout to the new branch with your name (`git checkout -b react-03/Serhii`)
2. Commit your solution
3. Push it to your branch (not to the main branch!)

4. Add other inputs
5. All inputs state should be stored in CreateStudent component
6. Style CreateStudent with css modules
7. Add missing prop types
8. Use conditions to not render some component (both ternary `?:` and inline `&&`)

## for Pros

1. Create method handleCreate in App component to receive whole object of student
2. App component should use created student
3. Add functionality if one user answering for others "answers" button should be disabled. Tip: button has prop `disabled={<boolean>}`
